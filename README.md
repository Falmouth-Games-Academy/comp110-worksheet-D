My implementation of tic-tac-toe. I wasn't sure if created new classes was ok for this assignment so I wrote all functions in oxo.py. Obviously, utility functions like compare_lists and covert_to_1d_index should be in a seperate class.  


The evalutate board function I wrote returns the number of wins a player has. This is not necessary for this brief but would be useful if an ai was added as the number of wins could be used in a hueristic evaluation.  


Win evalutation is based on a c# version I made some time ago. I'm fairly sure that version used some ideas and techniques from here: http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/minimax/
